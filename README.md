vertx-scala
===========
Next Steps:

- Build vert-web
- Build vert-unit

After these two work we have enough material to continue improving the API before continuing to all the other modules.

The following things should then be tackled next (the order is a mere suggestion):

1. Introduce Promises for handling of AsyncResult
2. Introduce Option for handling of @Nullable
3. Generate Docs (docs are already being generated but results aren't conforming to ScalaDoc)

There are TODO-markers in the MVEL-templates to highlight the starting points for them.
