^|Name | Type ^| Description
|[[allowRcptErrors]]`@allowRcptErrors`|`Boolean`|+++
set if sending allows rcpt errors
 <p>
 if true, the mail will be sent to the recipients that the server accepted, if any
 <p>
+++
|[[authMethods]]`@authMethods`|`String`|+++
set string of allowed auth methods.
 if set only these methods will be used
 if the server supports them. If null or empty all supported methods may be
 used
+++
|[[disableEsmtp]]`@disableEsmtp`|`Boolean`|+++
set if ESMTP should be tried as first command (EHLO)
 <p>
 rfc 1869 states that clients should always attempt EHLO as first command to determine if ESMTP
 is supported, if this returns an error code, HELO is tried to use old SMTP.
 If there is a server that does not support EHLO and does not give an error code back, the connection
 should be closed and retried with HELO. We do not do that and rather support turning off ESMTP with a
 setting. The odds of this actually happening are very small since the client will not connect to arbitrary
 smtp hosts on the internet. Since the client knows that is connects to a host that doesn't support ESMTP/EHLO
 in that way, the property has to be set to false.
