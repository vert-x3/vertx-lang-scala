= Vert.x Service Discovery

This components provides an infrastructure to publish and discover various resources, such as service
proxies, HTTP endpoints, data sources...

These resources are called `services`. A `service` is a discoverable
functionality. It can be qualified by its type, metadata, and location. So a `service` can be a database, a
service proxy, a HTTP endpoint and any other resource you can imagine as soon as you can describe it and interact
with it. It does not have to be a vert.x entity, but can be anything. Each service is described by a
`link:../dataobjects.html#Record[Record]`.

The service discovery implements the interactions defined in service-oriented computing. And to some extend,
also provides the dynamic service-oriented computing interactions. So, applications can react to arrival and
departure of services.

A service provider can:

* publish a service record
* un-publish a published record
* update the status of a published service (down, out of service...)

A service consumer can:

* lookup services
* bind to a selected service (it gets a `link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/ServiceReference.html[ServiceReference]`) and use it
* release the service once the consumer is done with it
* listen for arrival, departure and modification of services.

Consumer would 1) lookup a service record matching their need, 2) retrieve the
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/ServiceReference.html[ServiceReference]` that give access to the service, 3) get a service object to access
the service, 4) release the service object once done.

As stated above, the central piece of information shared by the providers and consumers are
`link:../dataobjects.html#Record[records]`.

Providers and consumers must create their own `link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/ServiceDiscovery.html[ServiceDiscovery]` instance. These
instances are collaborating in the background (distributed structure) to keep the set of services in sync.

The service discovery supports bridges to import and export services from / to other discovery technologies.

== Using the service discovery

To use the Vert.x service discovery, add the following dependency to the _dependencies_ section of your build
descriptor:

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
<groupId>${maven.groupId}</groupId>
<artifactId>${maven.artifactId}</artifactId>
<version>${maven.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

* Gradle (in your `build.gradle` file):

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
compile '${maven.groupId}:${maven.artifactId}:${maven.version}'
----

== Overall concepts

The discovery mechanism is based on a few concepts explained in this section.

=== Service records

A service `link:../dataobjects.html#Record[Record]` is an object that describes a service published by a service
provider. It contains a name, some metadata, a location object (describing where is the service). This record is
the only object shared by the provider (having published it) and the consumer (retrieve it when doing a lookup).

The metadata and even the location format depend on the `service type` (see below).

A record is published when the provider is ready to be used, and withdrawn when the service provider is stopping.

=== Service Provider and publisher

A service provider is an entity providing a _service_. The publisher is responsible for publishing a record
describing the provider. It may be a single entity (a provider publishing itself) or a different entity.

=== Service Consumer

Service consumers search for services in the service discovery. Each lookup retrieves `0..n`
`link:../dataobjects.html#Record[Record]`. From these records, a consumer can retrieve a
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/ServiceReference.html[ServiceReference]`, representing the binding between the consumer and the provider.
This reference allows the consumer to retrieve the _service object_ (to use the service),  and release the service.

It is important to release service references to cleanup the objects and update the service usages.

=== Service object

The service object is the object that gives access to a service. It can come in various forms, such as a proxy, a client,
and may even be non-existent for some service types. The nature of the service object depends on the service type.

=== Service types

Services are just resources, and they exist in wide variety. They can be functional services, databases,
REST APIs, and so on. The Vert.x service discovery has the concept of service types to handle this heterogeneity.
Each type defines:

* how the service is located (URI, event bus address, IP / DNS...)
* the nature of the service object (service proxy, HTTP client, message consumer...)

Some service types are implemented and provided by the service discovery component, but you can add
your own.

=== Service events

Every time a service provider is published or withdrawn, an event is fired on the event bus. This event contains
the record that has been modified.

In addition, in order to track who is using who, every time a reference is retrieved with
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/ServiceDiscovery.html#getReference(io.vertx.servicediscovery.Record)[getReference]` or released with
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/ServiceReference.html#release()[release]`, events are emitted on the event bus to track the
service usages.

More details on these events below.

=== Backend

The service discovery uses a distributed structure to store the records. So, all members of the cluster have access
to all the records. This is the default backend implementation. You can implement your own by implementing the
`ServiceDiscoveryBackend` SPI.

Notice that the discovery does not require vert.x clustering. In single-node mode, the map is a local map. It can
be populated with `link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/spi/ServiceImporter.html[ServiceImporter]`s.

== Creating a service discovery instance

Publishers and consumers must create their own `link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/ServiceDiscovery.html[ServiceDiscovery]`
instance to use the discovery infrastructure:

[source,scala]
----
import io.vertx.scala.servicediscovery.ServiceDiscovery
// Use default configuration
var discovery = ServiceDiscovery.create(vertx)

// Customize the configuration
discovery = ServiceDiscovery.create(vertx, ServiceDiscoveryOptions()
  .setAnnounceAddress("service-announce")
  .setName("my-name")
)

// Do something...

discovery.close()

----

By default, the announce address (the event bus address on which service events are sent is: `vertx.discovery
.announce`. You can also configure a name used for the service usage (see section about service usage).

When you don't need the service discovery object anymore, don't forget to close it. It closes the different discovery bridges you
have configured and releases the service references.

== Publishing services

Once you have a service discovery instance, you can start to publish services. The process is the following:

1. create a record for a specific service provider
2. publish this record
3. keep the published record that is used to un-publish a service or modify it.

To create records, you can either use the `link:../dataobjects.html#Record[Record]` class, or use convenient methods
from the service types.

[source,scala]
----
import io.vertx.scala.servicediscovery.types.HttpEndpoint
// Manual record creation
var record = Record()
  .setType("eventbus-service-proxy")
  .setLocation(todo-renderJsonObject)
  .setName("my-service")
  .setMetadata(todo-renderJsonObject)


discovery.publishFuture(record).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    // publication succeeded
    var publishedRecord = result
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")}
}

// Record creation from a type
record = HttpEndpoint.createRecord("some-rest-api", "localhost", 8080, "/api")
discovery.publishFuture(record).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    // publication succeeded
    var publishedRecord = result
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")}
}

----

It is important to keep a reference on the returned records, as this record has been extended by a `registration id`.

== Withdrawing services

To withdraw (un-publish) a record, use:

[source,scala]
----

discovery.unpublishFuture(todo-renderDataObjectMemberSelect).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    // Ok
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")}
}

----

== Looking for service

On the consumer side, the first thing to do is to lookup for records. You can search for a single record or all
the matching ones. In the first case, the first matching record is returned.

Consumer can pass a filter to select the service. There are two ways to describe the filter:

1. A function taking a `link:../dataobjects.html#Record[Record]` as parameter and returning a boolean
2. This filter is a JSON object. Each entry of the given filter is checked against the record. All entries must
exactly match the record. The entry can use the special `*` value to denote a requirement on the key, but not on
the value.

Let's see an example of a JSON filter:
----
{ "name" = "a" } => matches records with name set to "a"
{ "color" = "*" } => matches records with "color" set
{ "color" = "red" } => only matches records with "color" set to "red"
{ "color" = "red", "name" = "a"} => only matches records with name set to "a", and color set to "red"
----

If the JSON filter is not set (`null` or empty), it accepts all records. When using functions, to accept all
records, you must return _true_ regardless the record.

Here are some examples:

[source,scala]
----
// Get any record
discovery.getRecordFuture((r: io.vertx.scala.servicediscovery.Record) => {
  true
}).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    if (result != null) {
      // we have a record
    } else {
      // the lookup succeeded, but no matching service
    }
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")}
}

discovery.getRecordFuture(null).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    if (result != null) {
      // we have a record
    } else {
      // the lookup succeeded, but no matching service
    }
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")}
}


// Get a record by name
discovery.getRecordFuture((r: io.vertx.scala.servicediscovery.Record) => {
  todo-renderDataObjectMemberSelect == "some-name"
}).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    if (result != null) {
      // we have a record
    } else {
      // the lookup succeeded, but no matching service
    }
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")}
}

discovery.getRecordFuture(todo-renderJsonObject).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    if (result != null) {
      // we have a record
    } else {
      // the lookup succeeded, but no matching service
    }
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")}
}

// Get all records matching the filter
discovery.getRecordsFuture((r: io.vertx.scala.servicediscovery.Record) => {
  "some-value" == todo-renderDataObjectMemberSelect.some-label
}).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    var results = result
    // If the list is not empty, we have matching record
    // Else, the lookup succeeded, but no matching service
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")}
}


discovery.getRecordsFuture(todo-renderJsonObject).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    var results = result
    // If the list is not empty, we have matching record
    // Else, the lookup succeeded, but no matching service
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")}
}



----

You can retrieve a single record or all matching records with
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/ServiceDiscovery.html#getRecords(io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject,%20io.vertx.core.Handler)[getRecords]`.
By default, record lookup does include only records with a `status` set to `UP`. This can be overridden:

* when using JSON filter, just set `status` to the value you want (or `*` to accept all status)
* when using function, set the `includeOutOfService` parameter to `true` in
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/ServiceDiscovery.html#getRecords(java.util.function.Function,%20boolean,%20io.vertx.core.Handler)[getRecords]`
.

== Retrieving a service reference

Once you have chosen the `link:../dataobjects.html#Record[Record]`, you can retrieve a
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/ServiceReference.html[ServiceReference]` and then the service object:

[source,scala]
----
var reference = discovery.getReference(record)

// Then, gets the service object, the returned type depends on the service type:
// For http endpoint:
var client = reference.get()
// For message source
var consumer = reference.get()

// When done with the service
reference.release()

----

Don't forget to release the reference once done.

The service reference represents a binding with the service provider.

When retrieving a service reference you can pass a `JsonObject` used to configure the
service object. It can contain various data about the service object. Some service types do not needs additional
configuration, some require configuration (as data sources):

[source,scala]
----
var reference = discovery.getReferenceWithConfiguration(record, conf)

// Then, gets the service object, the returned type depends on the service type:
// For http endpoint:
var client = reference.get()

// Do something with the client...

// When done with the service
reference.release()

----

== Types of services

A said above, the service discovery has the service type concept to manage the heterogeneity of the
different services.

These types are provided by default:

* `link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/types/HttpEndpoint.html[HttpEndpoint]` - for REST API's, the service object is a
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/core/http/HttpClient.html[HttpClient]` configured on the host and port (the location is the url).
* `link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/types/EventBusService.html[EventBusService]` - for service proxies, the service object is a proxy. Its
type is the proxies interface (the location is the address).
* `link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/types/MessageSource.html[MessageSource]` - for message sources (publisher), the service object is a
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/core/eventbus/MessageConsumer.html[MessageConsumer]` (the location is the address).
* `link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/types/JDBCDataSource.html[JDBCDataSource]` - for JDBC data sources, the service object is a
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/ext/jdbc/JDBCClient.html[JDBCClient]` (the configuration of the client is computed from the location, metadata and
consumer configuration).

This section gives details about service types in general and describes how to use the default service types.

=== Services with no type

Some records may have no type (`link:todo[ServiceType.UNKNOWN]`). It is not possible to
retrieve a reference for these records, but you can build the connection details from the `location` and
`metadata` of the `link:../dataobjects.html#Record[Record]`.

Using these services does not fire service usage events.



=== HTTP endpoints

A HTTP endpoint represents a REST API or a service accessible using HTTP requests. The HTTP endpoint service
objects are `link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/core/http/HttpClient.html[HttpClient]` configured with the host, port and ssl.

==== Publishing a HTTP endpoint

To publish a HTTP endpoint, you need a `link:../dataobjects.html#Record[Record]`. You can create the record using
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/types/HttpEndpoint.html#createRecord(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20int,%20java.lang.String,%20io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject)[HttpEndpoint.createRecord]`.

The next snippet illustrates hot to create a `link:../dataobjects.html#Record[Record]` from
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/types/HttpEndpoint.html[HttpEndpoint]`:

[source, scala]
----
import io.vertx.scala.servicediscovery.types.HttpEndpoint
var record1 = HttpEndpoint.createRecord("some-http-service", "localhost", 8433, "/api")

discovery.publishFuture(record1).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => println("Success")
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

var record2 = HttpEndpoint.createRecord("some-other-name", true, "localhost", 8433, "/api", todo-renderJsonObject)


----

When you run your service in a container or on the cloud, it may not know its public IP and public port, so the
publication must be done by another entity having this info. Generally it's a bridge.

==== Consuming a HTTP endpoint

Once a HTTP endpoint is published, a consumer can retrieve it. The service object is a
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/core/http/HttpClient.html[HttpClient]` with a port and host configured:

[source, scala]
----
// Get the record
discovery.getRecordFuture(todo-renderJsonObject).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => println("Success")
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

----

You can also use the
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/types/HttpEndpoint.html#getClient(io.vertx.servicediscovery.ServiceDiscovery,%20io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject,%20io.vertx.core.Handler)[HttpEndpoint.getClient]`
method to combine lookup and service retrieval in one call:

[source, scala]
----
import io.vertx.scala.servicediscovery.types.HttpEndpoint
import io.vertx.scala.servicediscovery.ServiceDiscovery
HttpEndpoint.getClient(discovery, todo-renderJsonObject, 
  case Success(result) => {
    var client = result

    // You need to path the complete path
    client.getNow("/api/persons", (response: io.vertx.scala.core.http.HttpClientResponse) => {

      // ...

      // Dont' forget to release the service
      ServiceDiscovery.releaseServiceObject(discovery, client)

    })
  }
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
)

----

In this second version, the service object is released using
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/ServiceDiscovery.html#releaseServiceObject(io.vertx.servicediscovery.ServiceDiscovery,%20java.lang.Object)[ServiceDiscovery.releaseServiceObject]`,
so you no longer hold on to the service reference.

=== Event bus services

Event bus services are service proxies. They implement async-RPC services on top of the event bus. When retrieving
a service object from an event bus service, you get a service proxy of the right type. You can access helper
methods from `link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/types/EventBusService.html[EventBusService]`.

Notice that service proxies (service implementations and service interfaces) are developed in Java.

==== Publishing an event bus service

To publish an event bus service, you need to create a `link:../dataobjects.html#Record[Record]`:

[source, scala]
----
import io.vertx.scala.servicediscovery.types.EventBusService
var record = EventBusService.createRecord("some-eventbus-service", "address", "examples.MyService", todo-renderJsonObject)

discovery.publishFuture(record).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => println("Success")
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

----



==== Consuming an event bus service




=== Message source

A message source is a component sending messages on the event bus on a specific address. Message source clients are
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/core/eventbus/MessageConsumer.html[MessageConsumer]`.

The _location_ or a message source service is the event bus address on which messages are sent.

==== Publishing a message source

As for the other service types, publishing a message source is a 2-step process:

1. create a record, using `link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/types/MessageSource.html[MessageSource]`
2. publish the record

[source, scala]
----
import io.vertx.scala.servicediscovery.types.MessageSource
var record = MessageSource.createRecord("some-message-source-service", "some-address")

discovery.publishFuture(record).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => println("Success")
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

record = MessageSource.createRecord("some-other-message-source-service", "some-address", "examples.MyData")

----

In the second record, the type of payload is also indicated. This information is optional.



==== Consuming a message source

On the consumer side, you can retrieve the record and the reference, or use the
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/types/MessageSource.html[MessageSource]` class to retrieve the service is one call.

With the first approach, the code is the following:

[source, scala]
----
// Get the record
discovery.getRecordFuture(todo-renderJsonObject).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => println("Success")
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

----

When, using `link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/types/MessageSource.html[MessageSource]`, it becomes:

[source, scala]
----
import io.vertx.scala.servicediscovery.types.MessageSource
import io.vertx.scala.servicediscovery.ServiceDiscovery
MessageSource.getConsumer(discovery, todo-renderJsonObject, 
  case Success(result) => {
    var consumer = result

    // Attach a message handler on it
    consumer.handler((message: io.vertx.scala.core.eventbus.Message<io.vertx.scala.core.json.JsonObject>) => {
      // message handler
      var payload = message.body()
    })
    // ...

    // Dont' forget to release the service
    ServiceDiscovery.releaseServiceObject(discovery, consumer)

  }
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
)

----

=== JDBC Data source

Data sources represents databases or data stores. JDBC data sources are a specialization for databases accessible
using a JDBC driver. The client of a JDBC data source service is a `link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/ext/jdbc/JDBCClient.html[JDBCClient]`.

==== Publishing a JDBC service

As for the other service types, publishing a JDBC data source is a 2-step process:

1. create a record, using `link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/types/JDBCDataSource.html[JDBCDataSource]`
2. publish the record

[source, scala]
----
import io.vertx.scala.servicediscovery.types.JDBCDataSource
var record = JDBCDataSource.createRecord("some-data-source-service", todo-renderJsonObject, todo-renderJsonObject)

discovery.publishFuture(record).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => println("Success")
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

----

As JDBC data sources can represent a high variety of databases, and their access is often different, the record is
rather unstructured. The `location` is a simple JSON object that should provide the fields to access the data
source (JDBC url, username...). The set of fields may depend on the database but also on the connection pool used
in front.

==== Consuming a JDBC service

As stated in the previous section, how to access a data source depends on the data source itself. To build the
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/ext/jdbc/JDBCClient.html[JDBCClient]`, you can merge configuration: the record location, the metadata and a json object provided by
the consumer:

[source, scala]
----
// Get the record
discovery.getRecordFuture(todo-renderJsonObject).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => println("Success")
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

----

You can also use the `link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/ext/jdbc/JDBCClient.html[JDBCClient]` class to the lookup and retrieval in one call:

[source, scala]
----
import io.vertx.scala.servicediscovery.types.JDBCDataSource
import io.vertx.scala.servicediscovery.ServiceDiscovery
JDBCDataSource.getJDBCClient(discovery, todo-renderJsonObject, todo-renderJsonObject, 
  case Success(result) => {
    var client = result

    // ...

    // Dont' forget to release the service
    ServiceDiscovery.releaseServiceObject(discovery, client)

  }
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
)

----

=== Redis Data source

Redis data sources are a specialization for Redis persistence accessible.
The client of a Redis data source service is a `link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/redis/RedisClient.html[RedisClient]`.

==== Publishing a Redis service

Publishing a Redis data source is a 2-step process:

1. create a record, using `link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/types/RedisDataSource.html[RedisDataSource]`
2. publish the record

[source, scala]
----
import io.vertx.scala.servicediscovery.types.RedisDataSource
var record = RedisDataSource.createRecord("some-redis-data-source-service", todo-renderJsonObject, todo-renderJsonObject)

discovery.publishFuture(record).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => println("Success")
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

----

The `location` is a simple JSON object that should provide the fields to access the Redis data
source (url, port...).

==== Consuming a Redis service

As stated in the previous section, how to access a data source depends on the data source itself. To build the
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/redis/RedisClient.html[RedisClient]`, you can merge configuration: the record location, the metadata and a json object provided by
the consumer:

[source, scala]
----
// Get the record
discovery.getRecordFuture(todo-renderJsonObject).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => println("Success")
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

----

You can also use the `link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/types/RedisDataSource.html[RedisDataSource]` class to the lookup and retrieval in one call:

[source, scala]
----
import io.vertx.scala.servicediscovery.types.RedisDataSource
import io.vertx.scala.servicediscovery.ServiceDiscovery
RedisDataSource.getRedisClient(discovery, todo-renderJsonObject, 
  case Success(result) => {
    var client = result

    // ...

    // Dont' forget to release the service
    ServiceDiscovery.releaseServiceObject(discovery, client)

  }
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
)

----

== Listening for service arrivals and departures

Every time a provider is published or removed, an event is published on the _vertx.discovery.announce_ address.
This address is configurable from the `link:../dataobjects.html#ServiceDiscoveryOptions[ServiceDiscoveryOptions]`.

The received record has a `status` field indicating the new state of the record:

* `UP` : the service is available, you can start using it
* `DOWN` : the service is not available anymore, you should not use it anymore
* `OUT_OF_SERVICE` : the service is not running, you should not use it anymore, but it may come back later.

== Listening for service usage

Every time a service reference is retrieved (`bind`) or released (`release`), an event is published on the _vertx
.discovery.usage_ address. This address is configurable from the `link:../dataobjects.html#ServiceDiscoveryOptions[ServiceDiscoveryOptions]`.

It lets you listen for service usage and map the service bindings.

The received message is a `JsonObject` containing:

* the record in the `record` field
* the type of event in the `type` field. It's either `bind` or `release`
* the id of the service discovery (either its name or the node id) in the `id` field

This `id` is configurable from the `link:../dataobjects.html#ServiceDiscoveryOptions[ServiceDiscoveryOptions]`. By default it's "localhost" on
single node configuration and the id of the node in clustered mode.

You can disable the service usage support by setting the usage address to `null` with
`link:../dataobjects.html#ServiceDiscoveryOptions#setUsageAddress(java.lang.String)[usageAddress]`.


== Service discovery bridges

Bridges let you import and export services from / to other discovery mechanism such as Docker, Kubernates, Consul...
Each bridge decides how the services are imported and exported. It does not have to be bi-directional.

You can provide your own bridge by implementing the `link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/spi/ServiceImporter.html[ServiceImporter]` interface and
register it using
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/ServiceDiscovery.html#registerServiceImporter(io.vertx.servicediscovery.spi.ServiceImporter,%20io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject)[registerServiceImporter]`.

The second parameter can provide an optional configuration for the bridge.

When the bridge is registered the

{@link io.vertx.servicediscovery.spi.ServiceImporter#start)}
method is called. It lets you configure the bridge. When the bridge is configured, ready and has imported /
exported the initial services, it must complete the given `link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/core/Future.html[Future]`. If the bridge starts
method is blocking, it must use an
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/core/Vertx.html#executeBlocking(io.vertx.core.Handler,%20boolean,%20io.vertx.core.Handler)[executeBlocking]` construct, and
complete the given future object.

When the service discovery is stopped, the bridge is stopped. The
`link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/servicediscovery/spi/ServiceImporter.html#close(io.vertx.core.Handler)[close]`
method is called that provides the opportunity to cleanup resources, removed imported / exported services... This
method must complete the given `link:../../scaladoc/io/vertx/scala/core/Future.html[Future]` to notify the caller of the completion.

Notice than in a cluster, only one member needs to register the bridge as the records are accessible by all members.
