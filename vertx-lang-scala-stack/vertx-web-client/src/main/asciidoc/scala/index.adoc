= Vert.x Web Client
:toc: left
:lang: scala
:scala: scala

Vert.x Web Client is an asynchronous HTTP and HTTP/2 client.

The Web Client makes easy to do HTTP request/response interactions with a web server, and provides advanced
features like:

* Json body encoding / decoding
* request/response pumping
* request parameters
* unified error handling
* form submissions

The web client does not deprecate the Vert.x Core `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/core/http/HttpClient.html[HttpClient]`, indeed it is based on
this client and inherits its configuration and great features like pooling, HTTP/2 support, pipelining support, etc...
The `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/core/http/HttpClient.html[HttpClient]` should be used when fine grained control over the HTTP
requests/responses is necessary.

The web client does not provide a WebSocket API, the Vert.x Core `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/core/http/HttpClient.html[HttpClient]` should
be used. It also does not handle cookies at the moment.

== Using the web client

To use Vert.x Web Client, add the following dependency to the _dependencies_ section of your build descriptor:

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
 <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
 <artifactId>vertx-web-client</artifactId>
 <version>${maven.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

* Gradle (in your `build.gradle` file):

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
dependencies {
 compile 'io.vertx:vertx-web-client:${maven.version}'
}
----

== Re-cap on Vert.x core HTTP client

Vert.x Web Client uses the API from Vert.x core, so it's well worth getting familiar with the basic concepts of using
`link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/core/http/HttpClient.html[HttpClient]` using Vert.x core, if you're not already.

== Creating a web client

You create an `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/client/WebClient.html[WebClient]` instance with default options as follows

[source,scala]
----
var client = WebClient.create(vertx)

----

If you want to configure options for the client, you create it as follows

[source,scala]
----
var options = WebClientOptions()
  .setUserAgent("My-App/1.2.3")

options.setKeepAlive(false)
var client = WebClient.create(vertx, options)

----

Web Client options inherit Http Client options so you can set any one of them.

If your already have an HTTP Client in your application you can also reuse it

[source,scala]
----
var client = WebClient.wrap(httpClient)

----

== Making requests

=== Simple requests with no body

Often, you’ll want to make HTTP requests with no request body. This is usually the case with HTTP GET, OPTIONS
and HEAD requests

[source,scala]
----

var client = WebClient.create(vertx)

// Send a GET request
client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    // Obtain response
    var response = result

    println(s"Received response with status code${response.statusCode()}")
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")
  }
}

// Send a HEAD request
client.head(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    // Obtain response
    var response = result

    println(s"Received response with status code${response.statusCode()}")
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")
  }
}

----

You can add query parameters to the request URI in a fluent fashion

[source,scala]
----
client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").addQueryParam("param", "param_value").sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    // Obtain response
    var response = result

    println(s"Received response with status code${response.statusCode()}")
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")
  }
}

----

Any request URI parameter will pre-populate the request

[source,scala]
----
var request = client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri?param1=param1_value&param2=param2_value")

// Add param3
request.addQueryParam("param3", "param3_value")

// Overwrite param2
request.setQueryParam("param2", "another_param2_value")

----

Setting a request URI discards existing query parameters

[source,scala]
----
var request = client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri")

// Add param1
request.addQueryParam("param1", "param1_value")

// Overwrite param1 and add param2
request.uri("/some-uri?param1=param1_value&param2=param2_value")

----

=== Writing request bodies

When you need to make a request with a body, you use the same API and call then `sendXXX` methods
that expects a body to send.

Use `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/client/HttpRequest.html#sendBuffer(io.vertx.core.buffer.Buffer)[sendBuffer]` to send a buffer body

[source,scala]
----
// Send a buffer to the server using POST, the content-length header will be set for you
client.post(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").sendBufferFuture(buffer).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    // Ok
  }
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

----

Sending a single buffer is useful but often you don't want to load fully the content in memory because
it may be too large or you want to handle many concurrent requests and want to use just the minimum
for each request. For this purpose the web client can send `ReadStream<Buffer>` (e.g a
`link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/core/file/AsyncFile.html[AsyncFile]` is a ReadStream<Buffer>`) with the `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/client/HttpRequest.html#sendStream(io.vertx.core.streams.ReadStream)[sendStream]` method

[source,scala]
----
// When the stream len is unknown sendStream sends the file to the server using chunked transfer encoding
client.post(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").sendStreamFuture(stream).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    // Ok
  }
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

----

The web client takes care of setting up the transfer pump for you. Since the length of the stream is not know
the request will use chunked transfer encoding .

When you know the size of the stream, you shall specify before using the `content-length` header

[source,scala]
----
fs.openFuture("content.txt", OpenOptions()).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    var fileStream = result

    var fileLen = "1024"

    // Send the file to the server using POST
    client.post(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").putHeader("content-length", fileLen).sendStreamFuture(fileStream).onComplete{
      case Success(result) => {
        // Ok
      }
      case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
    }
  }
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

----

The POST will not be chunked.

==== Json bodies

Often you’ll want to send Json body requests, to send a `JsonObject`
use the `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/client/HttpRequest.html#sendJsonObject(io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject)[sendJsonObject]`

[source,scala]
----
client.post(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").sendJsonObjectFuture(new io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject().put("firstName", "Dale").put("lastName", "Cooper")).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    // Ok
  }
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

----

In Java, Groovy or Kotlin, you can use the `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/client/HttpRequest.html#sendJson(java.lang.Object)[sendJson]` method that maps
a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) to a Json object using `Json.encode`
method

[source,scala]
----
client.post(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").sendJsonFuture(new examples.WebClientExamples.User("Dale", "Cooper")).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    // Ok
  }
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

----

NOTE: the `Json.encode` uses the Jackson mapper to encode the object
to Json.

==== Form submissions

You can send http form submissions bodies with the `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/client/HttpRequest.html#sendForm(io.vertx.core.MultiMap)[sendForm]`
variant.

[source,scala]
----
var form = MultiMap.caseInsensitiveMultiMap()
form.set("firstName", "Dale")
form.set("lastName", "Cooper")

// Submit the form as a form URL encoded body
client.post(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").sendFormFuture(form).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    // Ok
  }
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

----

By default the form is submitted with the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type header. You can set
the `content-type` header to `multipart/form-data` instead

[source,scala]
----
var form = MultiMap.caseInsensitiveMultiMap()
form.set("firstName", "Dale")
form.set("lastName", "Cooper")

// Submit the form as a multipart form body
client.post(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").putHeader("content-type", "multipart/form-data").sendFormFuture(form).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    // Ok
  }
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

----

If you want to upload files and send attributes, you can create a `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/multipart/MultipartForm.html[MultipartForm]` and
use `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/client/HttpRequest.html#sendMultipartForm(io.vertx.ext.web.multipart.MultipartForm)[sendMultipartForm]`.

[source,scala]
----
var form = MultipartForm.create().attribute("imageDescription", "a very nice image").binaryFileUpload("imageFile", "image.jpg", "/path/to/image", "image/jpeg")

// Submit the form as a multipart form body
client.post(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").sendMultipartFormFuture(form).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    // Ok
  }
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

----

=== Writing request headers

You can write headers to a request using the headers multi-map as follows:

[source,scala]
----
var request = client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri")
var headers = request.headers()
headers.set("content-type", "application/json")
headers.set("other-header", "foo")

----

The headers are an instance of `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/core/MultiMap.html[MultiMap]` which provides operations for adding,
setting and removing entries. Http headers allow more than one value for a specific key.

You can also write headers using putHeader

[source,scala]
----
var request = client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri")
request.putHeader("content-type", "application/json")
request.putHeader("other-header", "foo")

----

=== Configure the request to add authentication.

Authentication can be performed manually by setting the correct headers, or, using our predefined methods
(We strongly suggest having HTTPS enabled, especially for authenticated requests):

In basic HTTP authentication, a request contains a header field of the form `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`,
where credentials is the base64 encoding of id and password joined by a colon.

You can configure the request to add basic access authentication as follows:

[source,scala]
----
var request = client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").basicAuthentication("myid", "mypassword")

----

In OAuth 2.0, a request contains a header field of the form `Authorization: Bearer <bearerToken>`,
where bearerToken is the bearer token issued by an authorization server to access protected resources.

You can configure the request to add bearer token authentication as follows:

[source,scala]
----
var request = client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").bearerTokenAuthentication("myBearerToken")

----

=== Reusing requests

The `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/client/HttpRequest.html#send()[send]` method can be called multiple times
safely, making it very easy to configure and reuse `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/client/HttpRequest.html[HttpRequest]` objects

[source,scala]
----
var get = client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri")
get.sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    // Ok
  }
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

// Same request again
get.sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    // Ok
  }
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

----

Beware though that `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/client/HttpRequest.html[HttpRequest]` instances are mutable.
Therefore you should call the `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/client/HttpRequest.html#copy()[copy]` method before modifying a cached instance.

[source,scala]
----
var get = client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri")
get.sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    // Ok
  }
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

// The "get" request instance remains unmodified
get.copy().putHeader("a-header", "with-some-value").sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    // Ok
  }
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

----

=== Timeouts

You can set a timeout for a specific http request using `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/client/HttpRequest.html#timeout()[timeout]`.

[source,scala]
----
client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").timeout(5000).sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    // Ok
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")
  }
}

----

If the request does not return any data within the timeout period an exception will be passed to the response
handler.

== Handling http responses

When the web client sends a request you always deal with a single async result `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/client/HttpResponse.html[HttpResponse]`.

On a success result the callback happens after the response has been received

[source,scala]
----
client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {

    var response = result

    println(s"Received response with status code${response.statusCode()}")
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")
  }
}

----

[CAUTION]
====
By default, a Vert.x Web Client request ends with an error only if something wrong happens at the network level.
In other words, a `404 Not Found` response, or a response with the wrong content type, are *not* considered as failures.
Use <<response-predicates, response predicates>> if you want the Web Client to perform sanity checks automatically.
====

WARNING: Responses are fully buffered, use `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/codec/BodyCodec.html#pipe()[BodyCodec.pipe]`
to pipe the response to a write stream

=== Decoding responses

By default the web client provides an http response body as a `Buffer` and does not apply
any decoding.

Custom response body decoding can be achieved using `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/codec/BodyCodec.html[BodyCodec]`:

* Plain String
* Json object
* Json mapped POJO
* `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/core/streams/WriteStream.html[WriteStream]`

A body codec can decode an arbitrary binary data stream into a specific object instance, saving you the decoding
step in your response handlers.

Use `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/codec/BodyCodec.html#jsonObject()[BodyCodec.jsonObject]` To decode a Json object:

[source,scala]
----
client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").as(BodyCodec.jsonObject()).sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    var response = result

    var body = response.body()

    println(s"Received response with status code${response.statusCode()} with body ${body}")
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")
  }
}

----

In Java, Groovy or Kotlin, custom Json mapped POJO can be decoded

[source,scala]
----
client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").as(BodyCodec.json(examples.WebClientExamples.User.class)).sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    var response = result

    var user = response.body()

    println(s"Received response with status code${response.statusCode()} with body ${user.getFirstName()} ${user.getLastName()}")
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")
  }
}

----

When large response are expected, use the `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/codec/BodyCodec.html#pipe()[BodyCodec.pipe]`.
This body codec pumps the response body buffers to a `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/core/streams/WriteStream.html[WriteStream]`
and signals the success or the failure of the operation in the async result response

[source,scala]
----
client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").as(BodyCodec.pipe(writeStream)).sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {

    var response = result

    println(s"Received response with status code${response.statusCode()}")
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")
  }
}

----

It becomes frequent to see API returning a stream of JSON objects. For example, the Twitter API can provides a feed of
tweets. To handle this use case you can use `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/codec/BodyCodec.html#jsonStream()[BodyCodec.jsonStream]`.
You pass a JSON parser that emits the read JSON streams from the HTTP response:

[source,scala]
----
var parser = JsonParser.newParser().objectValueMode()
parser.handler((event: io.vertx.scala.core.parsetools.JsonEvent) => {
  var object = event.objectValue()
  println(s"Got ${object.encode()}")
})
client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").as(BodyCodec.jsonStream(parser)).sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    var response = result

    println(s"Received response with status code${response.statusCode()}")
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")
  }
}

----

Finally if you are not interested at all by the response content, the `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/codec/BodyCodec.html#none()[BodyCodec.none]`
simply discards the entire response body

[source,scala]
----
client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").as(BodyCodec.none()).sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {

    var response = result

    println(s"Received response with status code${response.statusCode()}")
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")
  }
}

----

When you don't know in advance the content type of the http response, you can still use the `bodyAsXXX()` methods
that decode the response to a specific type

[source,scala]
----
client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {

    var response = result

    // Decode the body as a json object
    var body = response.bodyAsJsonObject()

    println(s"Received response with status code${response.statusCode()} with body ${body}")
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")
  }
}

----

WARNING: this is only valid for the response decoded as a buffer.

[[response-predicates]]
=== Response predicates

By default, a Vert.x Web Client request ends with an error only if something wrong happens at the network level.

In other words, you must perform sanity checks manually after the response is received:

[source,scala]
----
client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {

    var response = result

    if (response.statusCode() == 200 && response.getHeader("content-type") == "application/json") {

      // Decode the body as a json object
      var body = response.bodyAsJsonObject()
      println(s"Received response with status code${response.statusCode()} with body ${body}")

    } else {
      println(s"Something went wrong ${response.statusCode()}")
    }

  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")
  }
}

----

You can trade flexibility for clarity and conciseness using _response predicates_.

`link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/client/predicate/ResponsePredicate.html[Response predicates]` can fail a request when the response does
not match a criteria.

The Web Client comes with a set of out of the box predicates ready to use:

[source,scala]
----
client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").expect(ResponsePredicate.SC_SUCCESS).expect(ResponsePredicate.JSON).sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {

    var response = result

    // Safely decode the body as a json object
    var body = response.bodyAsJsonObject()
    println(s"Received response with status code${response.statusCode()} with body ${body}")

  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")
  }
}

----

You can also create custom predicates when existing predicates don't fit your needs:

[source,scala]
----

// Check CORS header allowing to do POST
var methodsPredicate = (resp: io.vertx.scala.ext.web.client.HttpResponse<java.lang.Void>) => {
  var methods = resp.getHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods")
  if (methods != null) {
    if (methods.contains("POST")) {
      ResponsePredicateResult.success()
    }
  }
  ResponsePredicateResult.failure("Does not work")
}

// Send pre-flight CORS request
client.request(HttpMethod.OPTIONS, 8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").putHeader("Origin", "Server-b.com").putHeader("Access-Control-Request-Method", "POST").expect(methodsPredicate).sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    // Process the POST request now
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")
  }
}

----

TIP: Response predicates are evaluated _before_ the response body is received. Therefore you can't inspect the response body
in a predicate test function.

==== Predefined predicates

As a convenience, the Web Client ships a few predicates for common uses cases .

For status codes, e.g `link:todo[ResponsePredicate.SC_SUCCESS]` to verify that the
response has a `2xx` code, you can also create a custom one:

[source,scala]
----
client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").expect(ResponsePredicate.status(200, 202)).sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => println("Success")
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

----

For content types, e.g `link:todo[ResponsePredicate.JSON]` to verify that the
response body contains JSON data, you can also create a custom one:

[source,scala]
----
client.get(8080, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").expect(ResponsePredicate.contentType("some/content-type")).sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => println("Success")
  case Failure(cause) => println("Failure")
}

----

Please refer to the `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/client/predicate/ResponsePredicate.html[ResponsePredicate]` documentation for a full list of predefined predicates.

ifeval::["scala" == "java"]
==== Creating custom failures

By default, response predicates (including the predefined ones) use a default error converter which discards
the body and conveys a simple message. You can customize the exception class by changing the error converter:

[source,scala]
----
Code not translatable
----

Many web APIs provide details in error responses.
For example, the https://developer.marvel.com/docs[Marvel API] uses this JSON object format:

[source,javascript]
----
{
 "code": "InvalidCredentials",
 "message": "The passed API key is invalid."
}
----

To avoid losing this information, it is possible to wait for the response body to be fully received before the error
converter is called:

[source,scala]
----
Code not translatable
----

WARNING: creating exception in Java can have a performance cost when it captures a stack trace, so you might want
        to create exceptions that do not capture the stack trace. By default exceptions are reported using the
        an exception that does not capture the stack trace.

endif::[]

=== Handling 30x redirections

By default the client follows redirections, you can configure the default behavior in the `link:../dataobjects.html#WebClientOptions[WebClientOptions]`:

[source,scala]
----

// Change the default behavior to not follow redirects
var client = WebClient.create(vertx, WebClientOptions()
  .setFollowRedirects(false)
)

----

The client will follow at most `16` requests redirections, it can be changed in the same options:

[source,scala]
----

// Follow at most 5 redirections
var client = WebClient.create(vertx, WebClientOptions()
  .setMaxRedirects(5)
)

----

== Using HTTPS

Vert.x web client can be configured to use HTTPS in exactly the same way as the Vert.x `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/core/http/HttpClient.html[HttpClient]`.

You can specify the behavior per request

[source,scala]
----

client.get(443, "myserver.mycompany.com", "/some-uri").ssl(true).sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    // Obtain response
    var response = result

    println(s"Received response with status code${response.statusCode()}")
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")
  }
}

----

Or using create methods with absolute URI argument

[source,scala]
----

client.getAbs("https://myserver.mycompany.com:4043/some-uri").sendFuture().onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    // Obtain response
    var response = result

    println(s"Received response with status code${response.statusCode()}")
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")
  }
}

----

== Sessions management

Vert.x web offers a web session management facility; to use it, you create a
`WebClientSession` for every user (session) and use it instead of the
`link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/client/WebClient.html[WebClient]`.

=== Creating a WebSession

You create a `WebClientSession` instance as follows

[source,scala]
----
var client = WebClient.create(vertx)
var session = io.vertx.ext.web.client.WebClientSession.create(client)

----

=== Making requests

Once created, a `WebClientSession` can be used instead of a
`link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/ext/web/client/WebClient.html[WebClient]` to do HTTP(s) requests and automatically manage any cookies received from the server(s)
you are calling.

=== Setting session level headers

You can set any session level headers to be added to every request as follows:

[source,scala]
----
var session = io.vertx.ext.web.client.WebClientSession.create(client)
session.addHeader("my-jwt-token", jwtToken)

----
