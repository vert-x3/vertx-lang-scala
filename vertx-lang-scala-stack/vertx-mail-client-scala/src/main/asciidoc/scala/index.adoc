= Vert.x Mail client (SMTP client implementation)

Vert.x client for sending SMTP emails via a local mail server
(e.g. postfix) or by external mail server (e.g. googlemail or aol).

The client supports a few additional auth methods like DIGEST-MD5 and has full
support for TLS and SSL and is completely asynchronous. The client supports
connection pooling to keep connections open to be reused.

To use this project, add the following dependency to the _dependencies_ section of your build descriptor:

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>${maven.groupId}</groupId>
  <artifactId>${maven.artifactId}</artifactId>
  <version>${maven.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

* Gradle (in your `build.gradle` file):

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
compile '${maven.groupId}:${maven.artifactId}:${maven.version}'

== Creating a client

You can send mails by creating a client that opens SMTP connections from the local jvm.

The client uses a configuration object, the default config is created as empty
object and will connect to localhost port 25, which should be ok in a standard
Linux environment where you have Postfix or similar mail server running on
the local machine. For all possible properties of the config object, see below.

The client can use a connection pool of the SMTP connections to get rid of the overhead of
connecting each time to the server, negotiating TLS and login (this function can be
turned off by setting keepAlive = false). A client can either be shared or non-shared,
if it is shared, the same connection pool will be used for all clients using the same identifier.

[source,scala]
----
import io.vertx.scala.ext.mail.MailClient
var config = MailConfig()
var mailClient = MailClient.createShared(vertx, config, "exampleclient")

----
The first call to MailClient.createShared will actually create the pool with the specified config.
Subsequent calls will return a new client instance that uses the same pool, so the configuration won't be used.

If you leave out the pool identifier, a default pool will be created. Note that the clients are
shared in the scope of a vertx instance only (so two different vertx will have different pools with the
same identifier).

The unshared client can be created the same way leaving out the identifier.

[source,scala]
----
import io.vertx.scala.ext.mail.MailClient
var config = MailConfig()
var mailClient = MailClient.createNonShared(vertx, config)

----

A more elaborate example using a mailserver that requires login via TLS
[source,scala]
----
import io.vertx.ext.mail.StartTLSOptions
import io.vertx.scala.ext.mail.MailClient
var config = MailConfig()
config.setHostname("mail.example.com")
config.setPort(587)
config.setStarttls("REQUIRED")
config.setUsername("user")
config.setPassword("password")
var mailClient = MailClient.createNonShared(vertx, config)

----

== Sending mails

Once the client object is created, you can use it to send mails. Since the
sending of the mails works asynchronous in vert.x, the result handler will be
called when the mail operation finishes. You can start many mail send operations
in parallel, the connection pool will limit the number of concurrent operations
so that new operations will wait in queue if no slots are available.

A mail message is constructed as JSON. The MailMessage object has
properties from, to, cc, bcc, subject, text, html etc. Depending on which values are set, the
format of the generated MIME message will vary. The recipient address properties
can either be a single address or a list of addresses.

The MIME encoder supports us-ascii (7bit) headers/messages and utf8 (usually
quoted-printable) headers/messages

[source,scala]
----
var message = MailMessage()
message.setFrom("user@example.com (Example User)")
message.setTo("recipient@example.org")
message.setCc("Another User <another@example.net>")
message.setText("this is the plain message text")
message.setHtml("this is html text <a href=\"http://vertx.io\">vertx.io</a>")

----

Attachments can be created by the MailAttachment object using data stored in a Buffer,
this supports base64 attachments.

[source,scala]
----
import io.vertx.scala.core.buffer.Buffer
var attachment = MailAttachment()
attachment.setContentType("text/plain")
attachment.setData(Buffer.buffer("attachment file"))

message.setAttachment(attachment)

----

When using inline attachments (usually images), it is possible to reference the images within a html message
to display html with the images included in the mail. 
Images can be referenced as <img src="cid:contentid@domain"> in the html text, the corresponding image has Disposition:
inline and the Content-ID header as "<contentid@domain>". Please note that RFC 2392 requires Content-ID values to be structured
like a Message-ID with angle brackets and a local and domain part using URL compatible encoding. None of this is not enforced
and most mail clients supports IDs without angle brackets or without domain part, the best practice is to use the strict format.
A valid example for a Content-ID value is "<filename%201.jpg@example.org>"

[source,scala]
----
import io.vertx.scala.core.buffer.Buffer
var attachment = MailAttachment()
attachment.setContentType("image/jpeg")
attachment.setData(Buffer.buffer("image data"))
attachment.setDisposition("inline")
attachment.setContentId("<image1@example.com>")

message.setInlineAttachment(attachment)

----
When sending the mail, you can provide a AsyncResult<MailResult> handler that will be called when
the send operation is finished or it failed.

A mail is sent as follows:

[source,scala]
----
mailClient.sendMailFuture(message).onComplete{
  case Success(result) => {
    println(result)
  }
  case Failure(cause) => {
    println(s"$cause")}
}

== Mail-client data objects

=== MailMessage properties

Email fields are Strings using the common formats for email with or without real
name

* `username@example.com`
* `username@example.com (Firstname Lastname)`
* `Firstname Lastname <username@example.com>`

The MailMessage object has the following properties

* `from` String representing the From address and the MAIL FROM field
* `to` String or list of String representing the To addresses and the RCPT TO fields
* `cc` same as to
* `bcc` same as to
* `bounceAddress` String representing the error address (MAIL FROM), if not set from is used
* `text` String representing the text/plain part of the mail
* `html` String representing the text/html part of the mail
* `attachment` MailAttachment or list of MailAttachment attachments of the message
* `inlineAttachment` MailAttachment or list of MailAttachment of inline attachments of the message (usually images)
* `headers` MultiMap representing headers to be added in addition to the headers necessary for the MIME Message
* `fixedHeaders` boolean if true, only the headers provided as headers property will be set in the generated message

the last two properties allow manipulating the generate messages with custom headers, e.g. providing
a message-id chosen by the calling program or setting different headers than would be generated by default. Unless you know
what you are doing, this may generate invalid messages.

=== MailAttachment properties
The MailAttachment object has the following properties

* `data` Buffer containing the binary data of the attachment
* `contentType` String of the Content-Type of the attachment (e.g. text/plain or text/plain; charset="UTF8", default is application/octet-stream)
* `description` String describing the attachment (this is put in the description header of the attachment), optional
* `disposition` String describing the disposition of the attachment (this is either "inline" or "attachment", default is attachment)
* `name` String filename of the attachment (this is put into the disposition and in the Content-Type headers of the attachment), optional
* `contentId` String describing the Content-Id of the attachment (this is used to identify inline images), optional
* `headers` MultiMap of headers for the attachment in addition to the default ones, optional

=== MailConfig options

The configuration has the following properties

* `hostname` the hostname of the smtp server to connect to (default is localhost)
* `port` the port of the smtp server to connect to (default is 25)
* `startTLS` StartTLSOptions either DISABLED, OPTIONAL or REQUIRED, default is OPTIONAL
* `login` LoginOption either DISABLED, NONE or REQUIRED, default is NONE
* `username` String of the username to be used for login (required only when LoginOption is REQUIRED)
* `password` String of the password to be used for login (required only when LoginOption is REQUIRED)
* `ssl` boolean whether to use ssl on connect to the mail server (default is false), set this to use a port 465 ssl connection (default is false)
* `ehloHostname` String to used in EHLO and for creating the message-id, if not set, the own hostname will be used, which may not be a good choice if it doesn't contain a FQDN or is localhost (optional)
* `authMethods` String space separated list of allowed auth methods, this can be used to disallow some auth methods or define one required auth method (optional)
* `keepAlive` boolean if connection pooling is enabled (default is true)
* `maxPoolSize` int max number of open connections kept in the pool or to be opened at one time (regardless if pooling is enabled or not), default is 10
* `trustAll` boolean whether to accept all certs from the server (default is false)
* `keyStore` String the key store filename, this can be used to trust a server cert that is custom generated (optional)
* `keyStorePassword` String password used to decrypt the key store (optional)
* `allowRcptErrors` boolean if true, sending continues if a recipient address is not accepted and the mail will be sent if at least one address is accepted (default false)
* `disableEsmtp` boolean if true, ESMTP-related commands will not be used (set if your smtp server doesn't even give a proper error response code for the EHLO command) (default false)

=== MailResult object
The MailResult object has the following members

* `messageID` the Message-ID of the generated mail
* `recipients` the list of recipients the mail was sent to (if allowRcptErrors is true, this may be fewer than the intended recipients)
