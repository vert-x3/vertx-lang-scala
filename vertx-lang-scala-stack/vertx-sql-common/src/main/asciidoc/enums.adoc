^|Name | Description
|[[READ_UNCOMMITTED]]`READ_UNCOMMITTED`|
+++
Implements dirty read, or isolation level 0 locking, which means that no shared locks are issued and no exclusive
 locks are honored. When this option is set, it is possible to read uncommitted or dirty data; values in the data
 can be changed and rows can appear or disappear in the data set before the end of the transaction. This is the
 least restrictive of the four isolation levels.
+++
|[[READ_COMMITTED]]`READ_COMMITTED`|
+++
Specifies that shared locks are held while the data is being read to avoid dirty reads, but the data can be changed
 before the end of the transaction, resulting in nonrepeatable reads or phantom data.
+++
|[[REPEATABLE_READ]]`REPEATABLE_READ`|
+++
Locks are placed on all data that is used in a query, preventing other users from updating the data, but new
 phantom rows can be inserted into the data set by another user and are included in later reads in the current
 transaction. Because concurrency is lower than the default isolation level, use this option only when necessary.
+++
|[[SERIALIZABLE]]`SERIALIZABLE`|
+++
Places a range lock on the data set, preventing other users from updating or inserting rows into the data set until
 the transaction is complete. This is the most restrictive of the four isolation levels. Because concurrency is
 lower, use this option only when necessary.
+++
|[[NONE]]`NONE`|
+++
For engines that support it, none isolation means that each statement would essentially be its own transaction.
