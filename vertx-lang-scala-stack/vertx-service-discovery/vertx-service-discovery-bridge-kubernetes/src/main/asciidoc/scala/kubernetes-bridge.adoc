=== Kubernetes bridge

This discovery bridge imports services from Kubernetes (or Openshift v3) into the Vert.x service discovery.
Kubernetes services are mapped to `link:../../vertx-service-discovery/dataobjects.html#Record[Record]`. This bridge only
supports the importation of services from kubernetes in vert.x (and not the opposite).

`link:../../vertx-service-discovery/dataobjects.html#Record[Record]`are created from Kubernetes Service. The service type is deduced from the `service-type` label or from the port exposed by the service.

==== Using the bridge

To use this Vert.x discovery bridge, add the following dependency to the _dependencies_ section of your build
descriptor:

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
 <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
 <artifactId>vertx-service-discovery-bridge-kubernetes</artifactId>
 <version>${maven.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

* Gradle (in your `build.gradle` file):

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
compile 'io.vertx:vertx-service-discovery-bridge-kubernetes:${maven.version}'
----

==== Configuring the bridge

The bridge is configured using:

* the oauth token (using the content of `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token` by default)
* the namespace in which the service are searched (defaults to `default`).

Be aware that the application must have access to Kubernetes and must be able to read the chosen namespace.

==== The Service to Record mapping

The record is created as follows:

* the service type is deduced from the `service.type` label. If this label is not set the service type is set to
`unknown`
* the record's name is the service's name
* the labels of the service are mapped to metadata
* in addition are added: `kubernetes.uuid`, `kubernetes.namespace`, `kubernetes.name`
* the location is deduced from the*first** port of the service

For HTTP endpoints, the `ssl` (`https`) attribute is set to `true` if the service has the `ssl` label set to `true`.

==== Dynamics

The bridge imports all services on `start` and removes them on `stop`. In between it watches the Kubernetes services and add the new ones and removes the deleted ones.

==== Supported types

The bridge uses the `service-type` label to induce the type. In addition it checks the port of the service. Are supported:

* ports 80, 443 and from 8080 to 9000: HTTP endpoint
* ports 5432 and 5433: JDBC data source (PostGreSQL)
* ports 3306 and 13306: JDBC data source (MySQL)
* port 6379: Redis data source
* ports 27017, 27018 and 27019: MongoDB data source

If present, the `service-type` overrides the port-based deduction.
