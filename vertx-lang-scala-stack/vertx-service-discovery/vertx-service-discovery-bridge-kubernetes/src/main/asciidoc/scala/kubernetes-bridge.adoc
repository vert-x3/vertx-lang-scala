=== Kubernetes bridge

This discovery bridge imports services from Kubernetes (or Openshift v3) into the Vert.x service discovery.

Kubernetes services are mapped to `link:../../vertx-service-discovery/dataobjects.html#Record[Record]`. This bridge only
supports the importation of services from kubernetes in vert.x (and not the opposite).

`link:../../vertx-service-discovery/dataobjects.html#Record[Record]` are created from Kubernetes Service. The service type is deduced from the `service.type` label. If
not set, the service is imported as `unknown`. Only `http-endpoint` are supported for now.

==== Using the bridge

To use this Vert.x discovery bridge, add the following dependency to the _dependencies_ section of your build
descriptor:

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-service-discovery-bridge-kubernetes-scala_2.12</artifactId>
  <version>3.5.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

* Gradle (in your `build.gradle` file):

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
compile 'io.vertx:vertx-service-discovery-bridge-kubernetes-scala_2.12:3.5.0-SNAPSHOT'
----

==== Configuring the bridge

The bridge is configured using:

* the oauth token (using the content of `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token` by default)
* the namespace in which the service are searched (defaults to `default`).

Be aware that the application must have access to Kubernetes and must be able to read the chosen namespace.

==== The Service to Record mapping

The record is created as follows:

* the service type is deduced from the `service.type` label. If this label is not set the service type is set to
`unknown`
* the record's name is the service's name
* the labels of the service are mapped to metadata
* in addition are added: `kubernetes.uuid`, `kubernetes.namespace`, `kubernetes.name`
* the location is deduced from the **first** port of the service

For HTTP endpoints, the `ssl` (`https`) attribute is set to `true` if the service has the `ssl` label set to `true`.

==== Dynamics

The bridge imports all services on `start` and removes them on `stop`. In between it watches the Kubernetes
services and add the new ones and removes the deleted ones.
