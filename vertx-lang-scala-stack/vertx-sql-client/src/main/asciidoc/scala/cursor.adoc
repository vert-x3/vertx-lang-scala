== Cursors and streaming

By default prepared query execution fetches all rows, you can use a
`link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/sqlclient/Cursor.html[Cursor]` to control the amount of rows you want to read:

[source,scala]
----
`usingCursors01`
----

Cursors shall be closed when they are released prematurely:

[source,scala]
----
`usingCursors02`
----

A stream API is also available for cursors, which can be more convenient, specially with the Rxified version.

[source,scala]
----
`usingCursors03`
----

The stream read the rows by batch of `50` and stream them, when the rows have been passed to the handler,
a new batch of `50` is read and so on.

The stream can be resumed or paused, the loaded rows will remain in memory until they are delivered and the cursor
will stop iterating.
