== Using connections

When you need to execute sequential queries (without a transaction), you can create a new connection
or borrow one from the pool:

[source,scala]
----
`usingConnections01`
----

Prepared queries can be created:

[source,scala]
----
`usingConnections02`
----

NOTE: prepared query caching depends on the `link:../dataobjects.html#SqlConnectOptions#setCachePreparedStatements()[cachePreparedStatements]` and
does not depend on whether you are creating prepared queries or use `link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/sqlclient/SqlClient.html#preparedQuery(java.lang.String)[direct prepared queries]`

`link:../../scaladocs/io/vertx/scala/sqlclient/PreparedQuery.html[PreparedQuery]` can perform efficient batching:

[source,scala]
----
`usingConnections03`
----
